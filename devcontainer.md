# Development container

If you want to avoid installation issues and have a ready-to-use environment, you can use the provided [development container configuration](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json). A [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) that has all the necessary tools and dependencies installed, allowing you to work in a consistent environment that is independent of your local setup.

In this case, the development container is [configured](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) to have Node.js and the Playwright VS Code extension installed, along with typical command-line tools that are included in development containers.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that if you choose to use the development container, you will need to install Playwright browsers with a `--with-deps` flag. This is because the development container is minimal and does not include all dependencies required by browsers, for example fonts. In the exercise, install browsers in the development container with the following command:
>
> ```bash
> npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
> ```

To use the development container locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine and the [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed. Once Docker is set up, you can open the project in VS Code and it will prompt you to reopen the folder in the container. After reopening, VS Code will build the container based on the configuration and install all the required tools and dependencies as specified in the [`postCreate.sh` script](./.devcontainer/postCreate.sh).


## Development container in the cloud

If installing Docker locally is not your preferred option, you can also use the same development container in a cloud-based environment such as [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). GitHub Codespaces allows you to create a development environment in the cloud that is accessible through your browser or [your locally installed VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-github-codespaces-in-visual-studio-code). The developer experience in Codespaces is very similar to using a local development container or a local installation.

You can open the project in GitHub Codespaces by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace). After opening the repository in GitHub, you can create a new codespace by clicking on the "Code" button on the repository's front page and selecting "Open with Codespaces". This will create a new codespace that uses the same development container configuration, so you will have the same tools and dependencies available as if you were running it locally. This can be a convenient option if you want to avoid installing Docker or if you want to work from different machines without having to set up the environment each time.

Cloud based development environments are commercial services and may require a paid subscription. Be sure to check the pricing details of the service you choose to use. At the time of writing, GitHub Codespaces offers a free tier with limited hours of usage per month, and additional hours can be purchased if needed (see [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces)).
